PROJECT TITLE: Task1.java
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a binary search tree for maps.
VERSION or DATE: 
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Alison Ingrey
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
When running the code, the user will be prompted to choose to insert a choice
of inserting a key and value pair, viewing what the map has stored, viewing the height of the tree,
or using the get() method to return an associated value.

Option 1: Insert
For the insert option, the user is prompted to enter a key and a value pair.
The key must be an integer and the value must be a string value. The key and value must be entered
on the same line with no commas or punctuation separating them, just a space.

Option 2: View
Select option 2 to view your map.
You will see the key set, values, and entry set.

Option 3: Height
The height of a binary search tree is the length of the path from the root to the deepest node in the tree.
The height option will give the integer value of how many edges there are from the root to the deepest leaf.

Option 4: get method
The get method allows the user to enter a key and will return the associated value(s).
